Wordpress Importer does a basic import of a wordpress blog.
The main idea is that someone can take their old content and have it represented on a concrete5 site.

What it is doing:
  - Uses a wizard-like interface to import
  - Import is incremental -- keeps user in the loop and continues where it left off
  - Includes basic image import
  - Uses WP's own text formatting functions so everything comes through looking like a paragraph, etc

Not so great:
  - pages and posts import under the same page
  - No "Start Over" on the first step.  Choosing a new database when you have existing records doesn't do anything so the dialog shouldn't be there.
  - Not selecting a page to import under is very bad. Hundreds of pages show up under "home" and the link does not work at the WORDPRESSED step.
    - Should not proceed if "Posts" are going under Home. This basically ruins a site.
  - icon.png does not look good

Would be nice:
  - Have an option to import "posts" under one page and "pages" under another.
  - Option to import just posts or just pages.
  - Include a new page type called "WordPress Post" that is basically the "Blog" page type but without the lipsum text.
  - some kind of rudimentary support for image captions, like <div class="wp-import-image"> <img /> <span class="wp-import-caption">caption</span></div>
